whadyaneed bro? just do php scanner.php and let it do its magic, you do need to have a mumuplayer running adb on default port
and a window size of 1920*1080 and a lvl 8 rok account with individual power window open and scrolled to the top besides that
nothing else, the CSV is going to take time to produce, the rok account is probably going to be banned but it takes you about
3 hours to produce a new one from scratch so who cares. Stuff requires adb and tesseract you'll figure out how to install it if you
really want it.
